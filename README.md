# Hotel_Booking_System
This project is a simulation of a simple hotel booking system written in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming. The interface of this program allows users to book the rooms of their choice at any hotel they want. Furthermore, it enables them to consult the status of their payment, and of course cancel their bookings at any given time before the check-in date. As can be seen, the functionalities of this project are barely limited and can be found in any conventional hotel booking system, meaning that it is almost certainly ready to be used in real instances.
